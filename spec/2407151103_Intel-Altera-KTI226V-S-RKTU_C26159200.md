**_Introduction—I225/I_**

### 1.0 Introduction

The Intel® 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet Controller I225/I226 is a single-port, compact, low power Gigabit Ethernet (GbE)

controller. It is a fully integrated GbE Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) device, offering

10/100/1000/2500 Mb/s data rates. The interface-to-host system is a one lane PCI Express* (PCIe*) Gen 2 (5.0GT/s)

version 3.1.

**_Note:_** I225 v1 (B1 stepping) reaches 2.5 GbE on select switches/routers. Refer to the _Intel® Ethernet Controller_

_I225 Public External Specification Update_ for more detail.

#### 1.1 Feature Summary

The I225/I226 enables 2.5 GbE BASE-T implementations using an integrated MAC/PHT architecture. It can be used

for client systems, server systems and dock configurations such as desktop, laptops, workstations, server,

Thunderbolt™ dock in add-on Network Interface Card (NIC) or LAN on Motherboard (LOM) designs.

The I225/I226 is packaged in a small footprint VQFN package. Package size is 7 x 7 mm with a 0.4 mm lead pitch

and a height of 0.85 mm, making it very attractive for small form-factor platforms.

The I225/I226 supports the Intel vPro®. The interface to the vPro® engine is over SMBus as well as the PCIe link at

active system state.

The I225/I226 also supports a Time Sensitive Network (TSN) that can be used in Audio/Video Bridging (AVB)

applications and extended temperature applications that require TSN capabilities.

**Figure 1-1. I225/I226 High level Functional View**


```
I225/I226 —Introduction
```
##### 1.1.1 Ethernet Interface

The I225/I226 implements an IEEE 802.3 MII Management Interface, also known as the Management Data Input /

Output (MDIO interface), to the internal PHY. This interface provides the MAC and software the ability to monitor

and control the state of the PHY. The MDIO interface defines a special protocol that runs across the connection,

and an internal set of addressable registers. The interface consists of internal data line (MDIO) and clock line (MDC),

which are accessible by software via the MAC register space.

##### 1.1.2 Intel vPro

**®**

##### Interfaces

When the system is at its active state, the I225/I226 communicates with the Intel^ vPro® engine over PCIe. When the

system is at low power state (Sx), the I225/I226 communicates with the Intel^ vPro® engine over SMBus. The

I225/I226 and the Intel vPro® engine switch between these two interfaces according to the system power states
(identified by the PCIe bus state).

The I225/I226 supports the SMBus at 1 MHz. This interface includes these open-drain signals:

- Data In/Out signal - SMB_DATA
- Clock signal - SMB_CLK

Default SMBUS Slave Address:

- 0x59 (address 0xB2) for LOM/Discrete/NIC design.
- 0x49 (address 0x92) for Docking Station design.

##### 1.1.3 Configurable Software-Definable Pins (SDPs)

The I225/I226 also provides Software Defined Pins (SDPs) that can be used to drive or sense signals between

external devices and the I225/I226. The SDP pin can be driven or sensed by the I225/I226 software or can be

activated by the embedded 1588 timers.

##### 1.1.4 Feature Summary

#### 2.7.1 Leakage Avoidance on LAN Power Disconnect

When the I225/I226 is completely powered down using a FET to cut off the +3.3V_LAN power supply, there might be

leakage on these five pins:

- Pin 3 — PE_CLKREQ_N
- Pin 4 — ULP_WAKE_N
- Pin 10 — SMB_DATA
- Pin 11 — SMB_CLK
- Pin 12 — PE_WAKE_N

To avoid leakage, a basic logic MOSFET can be setup to prevent the leakage path. Refer to the I225/I226 Design

Checklist for more detail.

#### 3.2 Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Flash

#### 3.2.1 General Overview

The I225/I226 uses a Flash device for storing product configuration information. The Flash is consist of several

blocks listed in the sections that follow, summarized in Table 3 - 1 and shown in Figure 3 - 1. More granular modules in

the NVM are listed in Table 3- 1. The various blocks and its programming method are detailed in the following

sections. For its operation the I225/I226 requires a 1 MB Flash as a minimum and a 2 MB Flash if OROM is needed.

- **Legacy EEPROM** - Hardware accessed modules ( **Block 0** and **Block 1** ) — Loaded by the I225/I226 hardware
    after power-up, PCI reset de-assertion, D3 to D0 transition, or software reset. Different hardware sections in
    the Flash are loaded at different events. The hardware block is loaded to a shadow RAM in the device. It is
    located at the first 2 x 4 KB sectors in the Flash.
- **Secured Image** ( **Block 2** ) — The following data sections are protected by an RSA signature:

```
— CSS Header - The CSS header describes the modules within the protected block and includes the security
signature of the block. The CSS header is counted as part of the firmware module for the sake of its size in
the NVM.
```
```
— Firmware Module - The firmware module contains the code for the embedded controller, a list of
supported Flash devices and a RO update section. The firmware module is loaded at power up and
firmware reset.
```
```
— PHY Module - The PHY code is loaded by the PHY cluster for its functionality following a power up or any
reset that affect the PHY.
```
```
— Expansion/Option ROM Module (OROM Module) - This block is optional and might exist only on larger Flash
sizes than 1 MB. It holds code that is expected to be executed by the system at pre-operating system state.
The option ROM module might include the following sub-modules: PXE driver, iSCSI boot image, UEFI
network driver and can also include a CLP module.
```
- **Free Provisioning Module** ( **Block 3** ) — This block is used by software to program a new secured image.


```
I225/I226 — Interconnects
```
- **mDNS Records A / B** ( **Block3 / Block 4** ) — The mDNS records are used by the CSME firmware for mDNS
    offload proxy while the system is in D3. It is software’s responsibility to program these records before entering
    the D3 state. The mDNS records are expected to reside adjacent to the firmware space. So, the mDNS records
    are stored in the A space or B space (as shown in Figure 3 - 1 ) depending in the location of the secured image.
- **Software Free Access Module** ( **Block 4** ) — This module is used mainly by software. It also contains the
    mDNS records used by the Manageability Engine (ME) firmware for mDNS offload proxy while the system is
    in D3. Note that the structure of this block is outside the scope of this document.

**_Note:_** This document uses the terms NVM and Flash to refer to the non-volatile memory used by the I225/I226.

both terms have the same meaning.


**_Interconnects — I225/I_**

#### 3.2.2 NVM Security

The NVM update is protected by secured integrity check. It ensures that only an Intel approved image can be

updated on I225/I226 devices after manufacturing. The updated image is checked against a digital SHA

signature that is then encrypted by a private 2048-bit RSA Intel key. The modules that are protected by the secured

integrity check are:

- Optional OROM module
- PHY module
- Firmware module

Any updated image includes all these secured modules.

#### 3.2.3 Shadow RAM

The I225/I226 maintains the first two 4 KB sectors, Sector 0 and Sector 1 (block 0 and block 1), for the hardware

configuration content. At least one of these two sectors must be valid at any given time or else the I225/I226 is set

by hardware default. Following a Power On Reset (POR), the I225/I226 copies the valid lower 4 KB sector of the

Flash device into an internal shadow RAM. Any further accesses of the software or firmware to this section of the

NVM are directed to the internal shadow RAM. After a software command, modifications made to the shadow RAM

content are then copied by the I225/I226 manageability into the other 4 KB sector of the NVM, flipping circularly

the valid sector between sector 0 and 1 of NVM.

This mechanism provides the following advantages:

1. A seamless backward compatible read/write interface for software/firmware to the first 4 KB of the NVM as if
    an external EEPROM device was connected. This interface is referred as EEPROM-mode access to the Flash.
2. A way for software to protect image-update procedure from power down events by establishing a double-
    image policy. It relies on having pointers to all the other NVM modules mapped in the NVM sector that is
    mirrored in the internal shadow RAM.
3. A way to ensure that a hardware auto-load event, which occurs further to a PCIe reset event, can be
    completed within the PCIe timing constraints (100 ms) even if the Flash is occupied performing an erase
    operation initiated just before the reset.

Due to NVM security reasons, hardware does not allow any Flash accesses until the NVM is authenticated and the

Flash blocks are identified by the device.

#### 3.2.4 Protected Areas and Words

The I225/I226 provides a mechanism to protect against programming (write access) specific areas in the Flash as

follows:

- The two shadow RAM sectors (the first 8 KB of the Flash device) are write protected. During normal operation, this
    area is programmed only by the device (autonomously) following a request from the software updating the
    shadow RAM.
- The secured block containing the CSS header, firmware content, PHY cluster content and the OROM module is
    also write protected. Updating the secured block, software can program the free provisioning area and
    request the device to make it the next valid secured block. Once it is authenticated by the device, it becomes
    the valid secured block and then it is write protected.


```

The following table lists the protected words in the shadow RAM space.

#### 3.3 Network Interfaces

##### 3.3.1 Overview

The I225/I226 provide a complete CSMA/CD function with an integrated MAC and PHY. It supports the following link

speeds: 10 Mb/s; 100 Mb/s; 1000 Mb/s and 2.5 Gb/s. Full Duplex is supported at all link speed while Half Duplex is

supported at 10 Mb/s; 100 Mb/s only.

#### 3.4 Configurable LED Outputs

The I225/I226 provides three LEDs / GPIO pins that can be used to indicate different speed status of the link. The

default setup of the LEDs is loaded from the NVM word offsets 0x1C and 0x1F. This setup is reflected in the

LEDCTL register. The software device driver can change this setup accessing the LEDCTL register. For each of the

LEDs, the following parameters can be defined:

- LED Functionality (Mode): Defines which information is reflected by this LED as listed in Table 3 - 4.
- Polarity (IVRT): Defines the polarity of the LED.
- Blink mode (BLINK): Determines whether or not the LED should blink or be stable. In addition, the blink rate of
    all LEDs can be defined by the _Global Blink Mode_ flag in the LEDCTL register. The possible rates are 200 ms or
    83 ms for each phase. There is one rate for all the LEDs.

**Table 3 - 4. Link Mode Encoding**

```
LEDx_MODE (x=0...3) LED Functionality
```
```
0x0 LED_ON - Always high (Asserted)
0x1 LED_OFF - Always low (De-asserted)
0x2 LINK_UP - Asserted when any speed link is established
```
```
0x3 FILTER_ACTIVITY -^ Asserted when link is established^ and packets are being transmitted or received that passed
MAC filtering
```
```
0x4 LINK_ACTIVITY -^ Asserted when link is established and when there is no transmit or receive activity. When BLINK
is set, the LED is on if there is link and it blinks for activity (either receive or transmit).
0x5 LINK_10 - Asserted when a 10 Mb/s link is established
0x6 LINK_100 - Asserted when a 100 Mb/s link is established
0x7 LINK_1000 - Asserted when a 1000 Mb/s link is established
0x8 LINK_2500 - Asserted when a 2500 Mb/s link is established
0x9 SDP_MODE - The SDP pin functions as an SDP. SDP0...2 on LED 0...2 pins respectively.
0xA PAUSED - Asserted when the transmitter is PAUSED by the flow scheme
0xB ACTIVITY - Asserted when link is established and packets are being transmitted or received
0xC LINK_10/100 - Asserted when either 10 or 100 Mb/s link is established
0xD LINK_100/1000 - Asserted when either 100 or 1000 Mb/s link is established and maintained
0xE LINK_1000/2500 - Asserted when either 1000 or 2500 Mb/s link is established
0xF LINK_100/2500 - Asserted when either 100 or 2500 Mb/s link is established and maintained
The dynamic LED modes (FILTER_ACTIVITY, LINK/ACTIVITY, ACTIVITY, PAUSED) should be used with LED Blink mode enabled.
```

```
I225/I226 — Interconnects
```
#### 3.5 Transmission of PAUSE Frames

The I225/I226 generates PAUSE packets to ensure there is enough space in its receive packet buffers to avoid

packet drop. The I225/I226 monitors the fullness of its receive packet buffers and compares it with the contents of a

programmable threshold. When the threshold is reached, the I225/I226 sends a PAUSE frame. The I225/I

supports the sending of link Flow Control (FC).

#### 3.5.1 Operation and Rules

Transmission of link PAUSE frames is enabled by software writing a 1b to the _TFCE_ bit in the Device Control register.

The I225/I226 sends a PAUSE frame when Rx packet buffer is full above the high threshold defined in the Flow

Control Receive Threshold High ( _FCRTH0.RTH_ ) register field. When the threshold is reached, the I225/I226 sends a

PAUSE frame with its pause time field equal to _FCTTV_. The threshold should be large enough to overcome the

worst case latency from the time that crossing the threshold is sensed until packets are not received from the link

partner. The Flow Control Receive Threshold High value should be calculated as follows:

```
Flow Control Receive Threshold High = Internal Rx Buffer Size - (Threshold Cross to XOFF Transmission
+ Round-trip Latency + XOFF Reception to Link Partner response)
```
Parameter values to be used for calculating the _FCRTH0.RTH_ value are listed in Table 3- 5.

#### 3.5.2 Software Initiated PAUSE Frame Transmission

The I225/I226 has the added capability to transmit an XOFF frame via software. This is accomplished by software

writing a 1b to the _SWXOFF_ bit of the Transmit Control register. Once this bit is set, hardware initiates the

transmission of a PAUSE frame in a manner similar to that automatically generated by hardware.

The _SWXOFF_ bit is self-clearing after the PAUSE frame has been transmitted.

**_Note:_** The Flow Control Refresh Threshold mechanism does not work in the case of software- initiated

```
flow control. Therefore, it is the software’s responsibility to re-generate PAUSE frames before
expiration of the pause counter at the other partner's end.

#### 3.6 Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)

Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) Low Power Idle (LPI) mode defined in IEEE802.3az optionally enables power saving

by switching off part of the LAN device functionality when no data needs to be transmitted or/ and received. The

decision as to whether or not the LAN device transmit path should enter LPI mode or exit LPI mode is done

according to transmit needs. Information as to whether or not a link partner has entered LPI mode is detected by

the LAN device and is used for power saving in the receive circuitry.

I225 doesn’t support EEE, but I226 does support EEE

When no data needs to be transmitted, a request to enter transmit LPI is issued on the internal xxMII Tx interface

causing the PHY to transmit sleep symbols for a pre-defined period of time followed by a quiet period. During LPI,

the PHY periodically transmits refresh symbols that are used by the link partner to update adaptive filters and

timing circuits in order to maintain link integrity. This quiet- refresh cycle continues until transmitting normal inter-

frame encoding on the internal xxMII interface. The PHY communicates to the link partner the move to active link

state by sending wake symbols for a pre-defined period of time. The PHY then enters a normal operating state

where data or idle symbols are transmitted.

In the receive direction, entering LPI mode is triggered by receiving sleep symbols from the link partner. This

signals that the link partner is about to enter LPI mode. After sending the sleep symbols, the link partner ceases

transmission. When a link partner enters LPI, the PHY indicates assert low power idle on the internal xxMII RX

interface and the LAN device’s receiver disables certain functionality to reduce power consumption.

Figure 3- 2 shows, and Table 3- 6 lists the general principles of EEE LPI operation on the Ethernet Link.

#### 3.6.1 EEE Auto-Negotiation

Auto-negotiation provides the capability to negotiate EEE capabilities with the link partner using the next page

mechanism defined in IEEE802.3 Annex 28C. IEEE802.3 auto-negotiation is performed at power up, on command

from software, upon detection of a PHY error or following link re-connection.

During the link establishment process, both link partners indicate their EEE capabilities via the IEEE802.3 auto-

negotiation process. If EEE is supported by both link partners for the negotiated PHY type, then the EEE function

can be used independently in either direction.

The I226 supports EEE auto-negotiation. EEE capabilities advertised during auto-negotiation can be modified via the

_EEEEEE_2_5G_AN, EEE_1G_AN_ and _EEE_100M_AN_ flags in the IPCNFG register.


**_Non-Volatile Memory Map—I225/I226_**

### 4.0 Power Management and Power Consumption

#### 4.1 Power Management

The I225/I226 supports an intelligent power management scheme. The three global power states are as follows:

- When the system is at its functional state it auto-negotiates the link speed to the highest common
    denominator for best performance.
- When the system is at its low power state, the I225/I226 can be configured to auto-negotiate the link to lower
    speeds, saving system power.
- The I226 can be put into an Ultra-Low Power (ULP) state when the link is disconnected.

— Platform hardware needs to connect I226’s LAN_DISABLE_N pin to a GPIO at either platform or EC.

— System BIOS will need to implement the _On/ _Off method on the GPIO pin.

```
o Enable ULP entry on D3Cold entry: the _On method should de-assert (drive HIGH) GPIO connected
to LAN_DISABLE_N.
```
o **Exit ULP on D3Cold exit:** _Off method should assert (drive LOW) LAN_DISABLE_N.

— There are three ways to exit ULP:

o ULP by the user — Cable detected event (user plugs in the LAN cable).

```
o ULP by the host — On exit from RTD3, the operating system calls the BIOS _ON method that can be
assigned to de-assert the LAN_DISBALE_N pin using GPIO. This event causes ULP to exit.
```
```
o ULP by CSME — The CSME can trigger a ULP exit by asserting the ULP_WAKE_N pin. This can be done
by connecting SMB_DATA to ULP_WAKE_N.
```
#### 4.2 General Power State Information

##### 4.2.1 PCIe Device Power States

- D0 — Device is fully on. The I225/I226 is completely active (L0), in the link idle condition (L0s) or
    transitions to a link lower power state (L1).
- D1 and D2 — Not supported.
- D3hot — Where primary power is maintained. D3hot enters L1 to support clock removal on mobile platforms
    (for power saving feature).
- D3cold — Where primary power can be removed. If auxiliary power is still available, the I225/I226 can
    support wake-capable logic (L 3 ).

##### 4.2.2 PCIe Link Power States

- L0 — Link up (active). L0s is the link in the idle condition.
- L1 — PCIe link low power states, L1.1 or L1.2
- L2 — Support device D3cold with auxiliary power is still maintained. Note that sideband PE_WAKE_N
    signaling exists to cause wake-capable devices to exit this state. The power saving opportunities for this state
    include, but are not limited to, shutdown of all transceiver circuitry except detection circuitry to support exit,
    clock gating of all PCIe logic and shutdown of the PLL as well as appropriate platform voltage and clock
    generators.
- L3 — Link completely down (off). Power and clock are removed in this link state and there is no auxiliary
    power available. To bring the I225/I226 and its link back up, the platform must go through a boot sequence
    where power, clock and reset are reapplied appropriately.

The Ethernet Individual Address (IA) is a 6-byte field that must be unique for each NIC, and thus unique for each

copy of the EEPROM image. The first three bytes are vendor specific. For example, the IA is equal to [00 AA 00] or

[00 A0 C9] for Intel products. The value from this field is loaded into the Receive Address Register 0 (RAL0/RAH0).

The Ethernet address is loaded for LAN0 from Addresses 0x0 to 0x02 and for LAN 1, 2 and 3 from offsets 0x0 to

0x2 at the start of the relevant sections.

of this word should be calculated such that after adding all the words (0x00:0x3E),
including the checksum word itself, the sum should be 0xBABA. The initial value in the
16 - bit summing register should be 0x0000 and the carry bit should be ignored after
each addition. Note: Hardware does not calculate the checksum word during EEPROM
write; it must be calculated by software independently and included in the EEPROM
write data. Hardware does not compute a checksum over words 0x00:0x3F during
EEPROM reads in order to determine validity of the EEPROM image; this field is
provided strictly for software verification of EEPROM validity. All hardware
configurations based on word 0x00:0x3F content is based on the validity of the

### 6.0 802.1Q VLAN Support

#### 6.1 Overview

The I225/I226 provides several specific mechanisms to support 802.1Q VLANs:

- Optional adding (for transmits) and stripping (for receives) of IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tags.
- Optional ability to filter packets belonging to certain 802.1Q VLANs.
- Double VLAN Support.

#### 6.2 802.1Q VLAN Packet Format

The following diagram compares an untagged 802.3 Ethernet packet with an 802.1Q VLAN tagged packet:

including the 802.1Q tag header. Also, max frame size for an 802.1Q VLAN packet is 1522 octets as
opposed to 1518 octets for a normal 802.3z Ethernet packet.

#### 6.3 802.1Q Tagged Frames

For 802.1Q, the _Tag Header_ field consists of four octets comprised of the Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) and Tag

Control Information (TCI); each taking 2 octets. The first 16 bits of the tag header makes up the TPID. It contains the

“protocol type” which identifies the packet as a valid 802.1Q tagged packet.

The two octets making up the TCI contain three fields:

- User Priority (UP)
- Canonical Form Indicator (CFI). Should be 0b for transmits. For receives, the device has the capability to
    filter out packets that have this bit set. See the _CFIEN_ and _CFI_ bits in the _RCTL_.
- VLAN Identifier (VID)

The bit ordering is as follows:

**Table 6 - 2. TCI Bit Ordering**

```
Octet 1 Octet 2
```
```
UP CFI VID
```

```
I225/I226 —802.1Q VLAN Support
```
#### 6.4 Transmitting and Receiving 802.1Q Packets

##### 6.4.1 Adding 802.1Q Tags on Transmits

Software might command the I225/I226 to insert an 802.1Q VLAN tag on a per packet or per flow basis. If the _VLE_

bit in the transmit descriptor is set to 1b, then the I225/I226 inserts a VLAN tag into the packet that it transmits over

the wire. 802.1Q tag insertion is done in different ways for legacy and advanced Tx descriptors:

- Legacy Transmit Descriptors: The Tag Control Information (TCI) of the 802.1Q tag comes from the
    _VLAN_ field of the descriptor.
- Advanced Transmit Descriptor: The Tag Control Information (TCI) of the 802.1Q tag comes from the VLAN _Tag_
    field of the advanced context descriptor. The _IDX_ field of the advanced Tx descriptor should be set to the
    adequate context.

##### 6.4.2 Stripping 802.1Q Tags on Receives

Software might instruct the I225/I226 to strip 802.1Q VLAN tags from received packets. If VLAN stripping is enabled

and the incoming packet is an 802.1Q VLAN packet (its _Ethernet Type_ field matched the VET), then the I225/I226

strips the 4 byte VLAN tag from the packet, and stores the TCI in the VLAN _Tag_ field and the receive descriptor.

The I225/I226 also sets the _VP_ bit in the receive descriptor to indicate that the packet had a VLAN tag that was

stripped. If the _CTRL.VME_ bit is not set, the 802.1Q packets can still be received if they pass the receive filter, but

the VLAN tag is not stripped and the _VP_ bit is not set..

VLAN stripping can be enabled using two different modes:

1. By setting the _DVMOLR.STRVLAN_ for the relevant queue.
2. By setting the _CTRL.VME_ bit.

#### 6.5 802.1Q VLAN Packet Filtering

VLAN filtering is enabled by setting the _RCTL.VFE_ bit to 1b. If enabled, hardware compares the type field of the

incoming packet to a 16-bit field in the VLAN Ether Type (VET) register. If the VLAN type field in the incoming

packet matches the VET register, the packet is then compared against the VLAN Filter Table Array (VFTA[127:0]) for

acceptance.

The I225/I226 provides exact VLAN filtering for VLAN tags for host traffic and VLAN tags for manageability traffic.

##### 6.5.1 Host VLAN Filtering

The _Virtual LAN ID_ field indexes a 4096-bit vector. If the indexed bit in the vector is one; there is a Virtual LAN

match. Software might set the entire bit vector to ones if the node does not implement 802.1Q filtering.

In summary, the 4096-bit vector is comprised of 128, 32-bit registers. The _VLAN Identifier (VID)_ field consists of 12

bits. The upper 7 bits of this field are decoded to determine the 32-bit register in the VLAN filter table array to

address and the lower 5 bits determine which of the 32 bits in the register to evaluate for matching.


**_Electrical and Timing Specifications — I225/I226_**

##### 6.5.2 Manageability VLAN Filtering

The MC configures the I225/I226 with eight different manageability VIDs via the Management VLAN TAG Value

[7:0] - MAVTV[7:0] registers and enables each filter in the MDEF register.

Two other bits in the Receive Control register are also used in conjunction with 802.1Q VLAN filtering operations.

CFIEN enables the comparison of the value of the _CFI_ bit in the 802.1Q packet to the Receive Control register _CFI_ bit

as acceptance criteria for the packet.

**_Note:_** The VFE bit does not affect whether the VLAN tag is stripped. It only affects whether the VLAN
packet passes the receive filter.

Table 6- 3 lists reception actions per control bit settings.

```
1. X = Don’t care.

**_Note:_** A packet is defined as a VLAN/802.1Q packet if its _Type_ field matches the _VET_.

#### 6.6 Double VLAN Support

The I225/I226 supports a mode where most of the received and sent packet have at least one VLAN tag in addition to

the regular tagging which might optionally be added. This mode is used for systems where the switches add an

additional tag containing switching information.

**_Note:_** The only packets that might not have the additional VLAN are local packets that does not have any

VLAN tag.

This mode is activated by setting _CTRL_EXT.EXT_VLAN_ bit. The default value of this bit is set according to the

EXT_VLAN (bit 1) in the _Initialization Control 3_ NVM word.

The type of the VLAN tag used for the additional VLAN is defined in the _VET.VET_EXT_ field.


```
I225/I226 — Electrical and Timing Specifications
```
##### 6.6.1 Transmit Behavior with External VLAN

It is expected that the driver includes the external VLAN header as part of the transmit data structure. Software might

post the internal VLAN header as part of the transmit data structure or embedded in the transmit descriptor. The

I225/I226 does not relate to the external VLAN header other than the capability of “skipping” it for parsing of inner

fields.

##### Notes:

- If the _CTRL_EXT.EXT_VLAN_ bit is set the VLAN header in a packet that carries a single VLAN header is
    treated as the external VLAN.
- If the _CTRL_EXT.EXT_VLAN_ bit is set the I225/I226 expects that any transmitted packet to have at least the
    external VLAN added by the software. For those packets where an external VLAN is not present, any
    offload that relates to inner fields to the EtherType might not be provided.
- If the regular VLAN is inserted from the descriptor, and the packet does not contain an external VLAN, the
    packet is dropped, and if configured, the queue from which the packet was sent is disabled.

##### 6.6.2 Receive Behavior With External VLAN

When the I225/I226 is working in this mode, it assumes that all packets received have at least one VLAN, including a

packet received or sent on the manageability interface.

One exception to this rule are flow control PAUSE packets which are not expected to have any VLAN. Other packets

might contain no VLAN, however a received packet that does not contain the first VLAN is forwarded to the host,

but filtering and offloads are not applied to this packet.

See Table 6- 4 for the supported receive processing functions when the device is set to “Double VLAN” mode.

Stripping of VLAN is done on the second VLAN if it exists. All the filtering functions of the I225/I226 ignore the first

VLAN in this mode.

The presence of a first VLAN tag is indicated it in the _RDESC.STATUS.VEXT_ bit.

Queue assignment of the Rx packets is not affected by the external VLAN header. It might depend on the internal

VLAN, MAC address or any upper layer content.

    packets.

##### 7.2.3 Power Up Sequence


```
I225/I226 — Electrical and Timing Specifications
```
VDD (0.95V) must power up within 50 ms (power supply setting time) after 3.3 Vdc powers up. After power supply

settling time, all primary input signals to the I225/I226 should be defined.

The I225/I226 requires 3.3 Vdc from an external power supply. The I2 25 /I226 has its own VDD, the DC-DC internal

Switching Voltage Regulator (iSVR), which is derived internally from its 3.3 Vdc rail.

3.3V ramp up (t33rampup) should be at least 50 μs.

3.3V stable to VDD(0.95V) stable (tpower) should be less than 50 ms. 3.3V

ramp down (t33rampdown) should be at least 1 ms.

The VDD (0.95V) voltage ramp must never be higher than the 3.3V voltage ramp.
